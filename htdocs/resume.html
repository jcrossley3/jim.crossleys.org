              <td colspan="2">
                Responsible for the establishment of effective web
                infrastructure, development best practices, and knowledge
                transfer through research, collaboration, mentoring, and
                training. Development included both application and system
                software, with an emphasis on the latter.

                <ul>
                  <li>Developed an automated testing framework for
                  speech-enabled VoiceXML applications, capable of both
                  functional and stress testing. The service would compile
                  scripts written in a simple DSL into VoiceXML, place the
                  outbound calls on a clustered VoiceGenie gateway and tabulate
                  the results. It included a web proxy component that would
                  dynamically "decorate" audio files with specific DTMF tones
                  when requested by the application under test, enabling the
                  testing application to "hear" expected prompts in response to
                  specific inputs, e.g. DTMF, TTS, or audio. The entire
                  application was written in Ruby.</li>

                  <li>Led the design and development of middleware to
                  facilitate the exchange of data with 3rd-party web sites. The
                  multithreaded, high-throughput service provided a simple Java
                  API implemented as an EJB Stateless Session Bean enabling
                  access to 3rd-party databases exposed via any text-based HTTP
                  interface, e.g. SOAP, XML-RPC, or plain HTML. Encapsulating
                  the transformations of the clients' requests and responses
                  using XSLT stylesheets, the project used many best-of-breed
                  open source tools including HttpClient, JTidy, and
                  dom4j.</li>

                  <li>Developed a robust application of common Linux utilities
                  (ssh, rsync, at) to automate scheduled software distribution,
                  configuration changes and staged, reversible production
                  deployments to various secure networks of Linux servers.</li>

                  <li>Enabled customers to test their VoiceXML applications
                  hosted on their own web servers, providing secure access to
                  the system logs generated by the VoiceGenie platform within
                  our internal network, requiring sophisticated parsing of the
                  log files to only reveal data relevant to each customer's
                  specific application.</li>

                  <li>Developed project templates based on Maven and Struts
                  that enabled the quick construction of J2EE VoiceXML
                  applications stubbed out enough to be immediately deployable
                  and reasonably functional, resulting in a uniform source code
                  structure across all CPT projects for Struts actions, static
                  content, project documentation, and unit tests.</li>

                  <li>Instituted a policy of "idempotent system administration"
                  in which system configuration was maintained under revision
                  control, and installation shell scripts were written
                  according to a convention such that any compatible Linux
                  server could be configured with a specific "release" of
                  system software. This greatly simplified the management of
                  the applications' system dependencies.</li>

                  <li>Implemented a DMZ-style web architecture for hosting
                  customer voice applications. Used clustered Apache nodes as
                  SSL accelerators and reverse proxies to JBoss/Jetty app
                  server clusters, providing secure, efficient access to
                  various resources, including VoiceGenie VoiceXML gateways and
                  MySQL databases.</li>

                  <li>Championed the conversion of revision control system from
                  Starteam to Perforce after extensive evaluation of multiple
                  SCM products. Led the effort to port the existing codebase
                  and established administrative policies and procedures
                  resulting in a more streamlined project lifecycle and minimal
                  dependence on sys-admin personnel.</li>
